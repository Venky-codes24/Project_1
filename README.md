🌍 ImpactSense — Earthquake Impact Prediction


📌 Project Statement

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning–based predictive model that estimates the impact of earthquakes in terms of magnitude, damage level, or risk-zone classification.
The system uses geophysical and environmental data such as latitude, longitude, depth, seismic wave features, and geological parameters to assess possible damage or categorize the earthquake severity.
This project aims to support early disaster planning, emergency response, and awareness campaigns by providing accurate earthquake impact predictions.

🚀 Use Cases

🔹 Urban Risk Assessment
```
Description: Authorities can predict the level of impact an earthquake may cause in populated regions based on historical data.
Example: Predict which regions are at higher risk during a 5.5 magnitude earthquake using location and soil type.
```
🔹 Infrastructure Planning
```
Description: City planners can use the model to guide construction policies in high-risk zones.
Example: Predict risk level based on soil density and proximity to fault lines.
```
🔹 Government Disaster Response
```
Description: Emergency teams can prioritize regions for response and rescue based on expected impact.
Example: Rank areas for aid delivery after an earthquake using model predictions.
```
🎯Outcomes
By the end of the project, the team will:
```
Understand seismic data and its role in predicting earthquake impacts.
Preprocess and analyze geospatial and geophysical features.
Train and evaluate ML models for classification or regression of earthquake impact.
Optionally deploy the model using a simple user interface (UI).
Document model performance and results with visualizations.
