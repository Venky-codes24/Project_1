# 🌍 ImpactSense - Earthquake Impact Prediction  

## 📌 Project Statement  
The objective of **ImpactSense** is to build a machine learning–based predictive model that estimates the potential impact of earthquakes in terms of **magnitude, damage severity, and risk zone classification**.  

The system leverages **geophysical and environmental data** such as latitude, longitude, depth, seismic wave characteristics, and geological parameters to assess possible damage or categorize earthquake severity.  

This project aims to support **early disaster planning, emergency response, and public awareness campaigns**, ultimately helping communities build resilience against natural disasters.

## ⚡ Use Cases  

### Urban Risk Assessment  
* **Description** : Authorities can predict the level of impact an earthquake may cause in populated regions based on historical data.  
* **Example** : Predict which regions are at higher risk during a 5.5 magnitude earthquake using location and soil type.  

### Infrastructure Planning  
* **Description** : City planners can use the model to guide construction policies in high-risk zones.  
* **Example** : Predict risk level based on soil density and proximity to fault lines.  

### Government Disaster Response  
* **Description** : Emergency teams can prioritize regions for response and rescue based on expected impact.  
* **Example** : Rank areas for aid delivery after an earthquake hits, using model predictions.  

### Public Awareness & Education  
* **Description** : The system can be used to educate communities about seismic risks and preparedness strategies.  
* **Example** : Provide awareness campaigns with region-specific earthquake risk levels.
