## 📌 Project Statement  

The objective of **ImpactSense** is to build a **machine learning–based predictive model** that estimates the potential impact of earthquakes in terms of **magnitude, damage severity, and risk zone classification**.  

The system leverages **geophysical and environmental data** such as latitude, longitude, depth, seismic wave characteristics, and geological parameters to assess possible damage or categorize earthquake severity.  

This project aims to support **early disaster planning, emergency response, and public awareness campaigns**, ultimately helping communities build resilience against natural disasters.

## ⚡ Use Cases  

### 🏙 Urban Risk Assessment  
- **Description:** Authorities can predict the level of impact an earthquake may cause in populated regions using historical and geophysical data.  
- **Example:** Identify which regions are at higher risk during a *5.5 magnitude earthquake* based on location and soil type.  

---

### 🏗 Infrastructure Planning  
- **Description:** City planners can leverage the model to guide **construction policies** and design strategies in high-risk seismic zones.  
- **Example:** Recommending stricter building codes in earthquake-prone areas.  

---

### 🚨 Emergency Response  
- **Description:** Helps emergency management teams **prioritize relief operations** based on predicted damage intensity and affected risk zones.  
- **Example:** Allocating more medical facilities, shelters, and rescue teams to severely impacted areas.  

---

### 📢 Public Awareness & Education  
- **Description:** The system can be used to **educate communities** about seismic risks and preparedness strategies.  
- **Example:** Providing awareness campaigns with region-specific earthquake risk levels.
