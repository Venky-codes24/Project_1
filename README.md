## 📌 Project Statement  

The objective of **ImpactSense** is to build a **machine learning–based predictive model** that estimates the potential impact of earthquakes in terms of **magnitude, damage severity, and risk zone classification**.  

The system leverages **geophysical and environmental data** such as latitude, longitude, depth, seismic wave characteristics, and geological parameters to assess possible damage or categorize earthquake severity.  

This project aims to support **early disaster planning, emergency response, and public awareness campaigns**, ultimately helping communities build resilience against natural disasters.

## ⚡ Use Cases  

### 🏙 Urban Risk Assessment  
* **Description:** Authorities can predict the level of impact an earthquake may cause in populated regions based on historical data.  
* **Example:** Predict which regions are at higher risk during a 5.5 magnitude earthquake using location and soil type.  

---

### 🏗 Infrastructure Planning  
* **Description:** City planners can use the model to guide construction policies in high-risk zones.  
* **Example:** Predict risk level based on soil density and proximity to fault lines.  

---

### 🚨 Government Disaster Response  
* **Description:** Emergency teams can prioritize regions for response and rescue based on expected impact.  
* **Example:** Rank areas for aid delivery after an earthquake hits, using model predictions.  

---

### 📢 Public Awareness & Education  
* **Description:** The system can be used to educate communities about seismic risks and preparedness strategies.  
* **Example:** Provide awareness campaigns with region-specific earthquake risk levels.
